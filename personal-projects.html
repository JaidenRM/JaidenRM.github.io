                    This is my first attempt at Web Development and have taught
                    my self everything I have used. What I have used so far is
                    HTML to create the skeleton. I will be styling the website
                    with CSS and looking to add interactivity with JavaScript
                    and will look into adding some interesting frameworks like
                    jQuery or React. We shall see.

                <p>
                    Name is still TBD! Animal App will be developed for Android using Android Studio, Java, XML and Firebase. This is not my first Android app but it will be my first that I intend to release
                    to a large audience (Google Play Store). This project is currently on hold and hasn't left the conceptual stage. This
                    is due to the team being quite unsure of the direction of
                    the app and has left me with time to learn web dev.

                <p>
                    This app was inspired by my recent trip to Japan. I was excited
                    for going overseas for the first time and thought of this as
                    a way to use my coding skills to make something to record it.
                    The idea is basically to mimic a photo album onto a Google
                    Maps API. I.e. store each photo as a marker on a map with some
                    additional information. The design is quite simple and only
                    has core functionality (users, posts, view, storage) as this
                    was intended to just be for me and I needed something quickly.
                    I may come back to this to spruce it up whether it be through
                    additional features or 'beautifying' the display.

                    This is a project that I started to learn how to draw and
                    design graphics such as UI or Sprites. It also helped expand
                    on my C# skills. The game's premise is around the character
                    trying to find resources to stay alive with Minesweeper
                    inspired gameplay.
