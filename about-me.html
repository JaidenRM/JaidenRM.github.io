            <p class="greeting">
                Hi there,
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                I am a 2018 graduate from The University of
                Melbourne in a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computing and
                Software Systems. I am currently looking for work as a dev
                of any type as I do not particularly have a preference as of yet.
                I am just looking to gain experience and learn as much as I can
                about myself and programming in a commercial environment.
            </p>
            <p class="programming">
                I have worked/tinkered with a variety of areas such as Graphics
                using HLSL to develop shaders in Unity, to Android Dev and now
                Web Dev. I have explored these areas in my own time so I am self
                -taught for a majority of aforementioned fields. I find it really
                fun exploring new areas of programming and am constantly on the
                lookout to learn something new. It really excites me!
            </p>
            <p class="hobbies">
                Outside of programming I enjoy other interests life has to
                offer such as Reddit! I really relish in browsing the different
                areas of Reddit and finding out new and/or interesting information.
                I love listening to all different kinds of music constantly
                mix it up, and I really mean all kinds of music; for
                example I have a massive playlist I listen to dedicated to
                'Pirate' music. I enjoy getting together with friends to catch
                up and participating in our FOTM activity whether it be sport,
                movies or gaming. A final note on this subject would be I have
                really started to enjoy travelling and exploring new areas
                whether it be overseas or road trips, it is really refreshing
                taking in and exploring new areas/cultures.
            </p>
            <p class="conclusion">
                I hope you enjoyed getting to know a little about me and don't be
                afraid to get in touch with me. You can explore my GitHub profile
                or contact me through email. Information to do so are located at
                the footer of all the pages of this site.
