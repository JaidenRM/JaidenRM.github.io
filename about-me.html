                    <p>
                        I am a 2018 graduate from The University of
                        Melbourne in a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computing and
                        Software Systems. I am currently working as a full-stack
                        developer in a financial industry. I have been working here
                        since the start of 2019.

                    <p>
                        Outside of programming I enjoy other interests life has to
                        offer such as Reddit! I really like browsing the different
                        areas of Reddit and finding out new and/or interesting information.
                        Some typical things I enjoy like most are hanging out with friends,
                        music (I like to listen to a lot of different styles though) and
                        travelling (which I only recently found out I enjoyed). Another thing
                        I have gotten into lately is VR. I have bought myself an Oculus Quest
                        and love the freedom and flexibility it provides. It feels like a
                        big step for the industry to step into the mainstream.

                    The main tools used in my work will fall under the Microsoft Stack.
                    The languages I deal with daily are C#, SQL, Javascript and VB.
                    The frameworks I encounter mainly are ASP .NET Web Forms, JQuery,
                    LINQ and some MVC. Most products are offered as SaaS and I have worked
                    on developing new products and enhancing and maintaining existing ones.
                    My typical day consists on working on my set task/project and helping
                    out with support tasks/questions we receive daily regarding our products.

                        I have worked/tinkered with a variety of areas such as Graphics
                        using HLSL to develop shaders in Unity, to Android Dev and now
                        Web Dev. I have explored these areas in my own time so I am self
                        -taught for a majority of aforementioned fields. I find it really
                        fun exploring new areas of programming and am constantly on the
                        lookout to learn something new. It really excites me!
